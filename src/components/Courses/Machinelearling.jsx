            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Data Science (DS) are three interrelated fields in computer science and statistics. AI focuses on creating intelligent systems, ML enables computers to learn from data and make predictions, and DS leverages data to extract insights and drive decision-making. These three fields often overlap and complement each other in solving real-world problems and advancing technology.</p>
            <h1 className='text-2xl'>Data Science</h1>
            <p>Data Science combines statistical and computational tools to process and analyze large amounts of data. DS practitioners use their insights from data to inform decisions, predict trends, and improve the effectiveness of processes.</p>
